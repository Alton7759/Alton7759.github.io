### CPSC 120

* [Lab 11](https://github.com/cpsc-pilot-fall-2022/cpsc-120-lab-11-aaron-and-wilfredo)
Lab 11, part 1 is my favorite and at the top of this list because we learned how to use classes. It was always cool to be able to use int, double and float. even the std::string but almost making my own was really cool. unfortunately we didn't really make an class from ground up but only learned how to use one that was made.

* [Lab 12](https://github.com/cpsc-pilot-fall-2022/cpsc-120-lab-12-alton)
lab 12, part 1 is my second favorite because it was really the frist time we did something that I couldn't really find out myself. it was like learning how to do a big math formula. Also it was the frist time we used something bigger than adding or subtracting in normal life. I was able to use sin in this code.

* [Lab 8](https://github.com/cpsc-pilot-fall-2022/cpsc-120-lab-08-alton-and-jones-and-naranjo)
really all of lab 8 was my favorite when we stoped making little codes(nothing wrong to the other ones) but when we started working with other files. Being able to write and read files was so cool. My mind went wild thinking of all the cool things I could do with it.
